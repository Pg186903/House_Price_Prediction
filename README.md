Project: House Price Prediction
Overview

This project is a machine learning workflow to predict house prices based on key features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total area. The dataset (Housing.csv) is used as input, and the project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling.

Steps in the Notebook

  # Environment Setup & Data Loading
  
  # Uses Google Colab (files.upload()) to upload the dataset.

Libraries used:

  # numpy, pandas → data manipulation
  
  # matplotlib, seaborn → data visualization
  
  # warnings → suppress warnings
  
    data = pd.read_csv("Housing.csv")
    data.head()


Data Exploration
  
  # Checked dataset structure with .info()
  
  # Focused on the main columns:
  
  # price → Target variable (dependent)
  
  # bedrooms, bathrooms, area → Features (independent variables)
  
    required_columns = ['price','bedrooms','bathrooms','area']
    data = data[required_columns]


Preprocessing

  # Filtered dataset to keep only relevant columns.
  
  # Likely handled missing values and cleaned the dataset (to be confirmed further down the notebook).
  
  # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  # Used histograms, pair plots, and correlation heatmaps to understand:
  
  # Distribution of house prices.
  
  # How bedrooms, bathrooms, and area affect the price.
  
  # Relationships among variables.

Model Building

  # Applied Linear Regression to predict house prices.
  
  # Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
  # Trained the model on features (bedrooms, bathrooms, area) and target (price).

Model Evaluation

Used metrics like:

  # R² score → Model accuracy
  
  # Mean Squared Error (MSE) → Error analysis
  
  # Compared predicted vs. actual house prices using scatter plots or line plots.

Results

The model captures the relationship between features and house prices but may have limitations due to:
  
  # Dataset size.

  # Feature selection (only 3 features used).
  
  # Possible non-linearity in housing markets.

Key Features of the Project

  # Focused on simplicity: Only 3 features considered (bedrooms, bathrooms, area).
  
  # Good visualizations for feature relationships.
  
  # Applied a baseline regression model (Linear Regression).

Can be extended with:

  # More features (location, furnishing, parking, etc.).
  
  # Advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
  
  # Hyperparameter tuning.
