🏡 House Price Prediction
📌 Objective

The aim of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques based on key housing features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total area. By building a regression model, this project demonstrates how data-driven methods can provide insights into real-estate valuation.

📊 Dataset

Source: Housing.csv (uploaded manually in Google Colab)

  Features used:
  
    bedrooms → Number of bedrooms
    
    bathrooms → Number of bathrooms
    
    area → Total built-up area (sq. ft.)
  
  Target variable:
  
    price → House price

⚙️ Methodology

  Data Loading & Cleaning
  
    Loaded dataset in Google Colab.
    
    Selected only relevant columns: price, bedrooms, bathrooms, area.
    
    Checked dataset info and structure.
    
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
    Distribution plots for house prices.
    
    Correlation analysis to identify relationships.
    
    Scatter plots to visualize feature-to-price trends.
  
  Model Building
  
    Chosen model: Linear Regression.
    
    Train-test split applied to validate model performance.
    
    Evaluation
  
  Metrics used:
  
    R² Score (goodness of fit)
    
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    
    Visual comparison of actual vs predicted prices.

📈 Results

  The regression model was able to capture the basic relationship between features and house price.
  
  Price increases with more bedrooms, bathrooms, and larger area, as expected.
  
  However, model accuracy is limited due to:
  
  Small dataset size.
  
  Lack of categorical/location features.
  
  Linear model assumptions (housing markets are often non-linear).

🚀 Future Scope

  Add more features such as:
  
    Location, furnishing status, parking, property type.
  
  Apply advanced models:
  
    Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Networks.
    
    Perform hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
    
    Deploy model using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit for real-world applications.
